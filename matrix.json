The interaction of multiple pathways, molecules and systems determines whether fibrosis is self-limiting and homeostatic, or whether it is uncontrolled and excessive. Immune cells have been identified as key players in this fibrotic cascade, with the capacity to exert either injury-inducing or repair-promoting effects. A multi-organ approach was recently suggested to identify the core and regulatory pathways in fibrosis, with the aim of integrating the wealth of information emerging from basic fibrosis research. In this Review, we focus on recent advances in liver fibrosis research as a paradigm for wound healing in solid organs and the role of the immune system in regulating and balancing this response. \n     \nPubMed Disclaimer\n NCBI Literature Resources \nMeSH\nPMC\nBookshelf\nDisclaimer\n The PubMed wordmark and PubMed logo are registered trademarks of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

The digestion of alcohol is different for men and women because men have a higher concentration of dehydrogenase, an enzyme that breaks down alcohol. \u201cWhen alcohol, or ethanol, reaches the liver, the cells of the liver have enzymes that help with the digestion and processing of alcohol,\u201d explains Lance Stein, M.D., a transplant hepatologist at Piedmont Transplant. \u201cWhen alcohol then reaches the blood, that\u2019s when you feel the effects of alcohol.\u201d There is no denying alcohol is a toxin to the liver, says Dr. Stein. \u201cAs the liver is processing alcohol, it can damage the liver\u2019s enzymes, which can lead to cell death,\u201d he says. \u201cAs with any damage to any cell of any organ, there is always a process of healing.\u201d One of the most incredible facts about the liver is that it is self-healing, just like your skin. For example, if you cut yourself, the wound eventually scabs over as it heals and possibly leaves you with a scar. The same process happens in the liver. As cells die, scar tissue develops. This is known as liver cirrhosis. If excessive alcohol use and scarring continues over time, eventually the liver can become too scarred to function properly. Some alcohol-related liver damage can be reversed if you stop drinking alcohol early enough in the disease process. Healing can begin as early as a few days to weeks after you stop drinking, but if the damage is severe, healing can take several months. In some cases, \u201cif the damage to the liver has been long-term, it may not be reversible,\u201d warns Dr. Stein.  \u201cIt\u2019s important to know what you\u2019re drinking because when people mix their own drinks, they\u2019re often using more than the recommended amount,\u201d says Dr. Stein. \u201cThey think they\u2019re drinking one drink, but they\u2019re actually having two or three.\u201d One serving of alcohol looks like: 12 ounces of beer 5 to 6 ounces of wine 1.5 to 2 ounces of hard liquor The bottom line is that moderate alcohol use \u2013 no more than two to three drinks per day for men and one drink per day for women \u2013 should be acceptable and you should not expect any long-term damage. \u201cPeople who drink more heavily should be concerned and should seek medical counseling for assessment of whether they need assistance with stopping alcohol use or if they have any damage as a result of long-term alcohol use,\" says Dr. Stein.

Reviewed By: \nTinsay Ambachew Woreta, M.D., M.P.H  Your liver represents the human body\u2019s primary filtration system, converting toxins into waste products, cleansing your blood, and metabolizing nutrients and medications to provide the body with some of its most important proteins. As such a fundamental part of the body\u2019s overall regulation, it\u2019s paramount to keep your liver healthy and to limit overindulgence. In recent years, many products have flooded the market purporting to detox and cleanse your\u00a0liver, whether it\u2019s after a weekend of bingeing on food or alcohol, to maintain daily liver function, or to repair an already damaged liver.\u00a0Tinsay Woreta, M.D., a Johns Hopkins hepatologist, is here to help debunk persistent liver health myths and determine the value of cleanses. \nThough liver cleanses are packaged to claim that they\u2019re a cure-all for\ndaily liver health and overindulgence, Johns Hopkins hepatologists do not\nrecommend them. \u201cUnfortunately, these products are not regulated by the\nFDA, and thus are not uniform and have not been adequately tested in\nclinical trials,\u201d explains Woreta.\n \nWhile some common ingredients in liver cleanses have been shown to have\npositive results \u2014 milk thistle has been shown to decrease liver\ninflammation, and turmeric extract has been shown to protect against liver\ninjury \u2014 there have not been adequate clinical trial data in humans to\nrecommend the routine use of these natural compounds for prevention.\n \nAs for overindulgence of alcohol or food, less is always best when it comes\nto liver health, and cleanses have not been proven to rid your body of\ndamage from excess consumption.\n \nMany liver detoxification products are also sold as weight loss cleanses.\nHowever, there are no clinical data to support the efficacy of these\ncleanses. In fact, some dietary supplements can actually cause harm to the\nliver by leading to drug-induced injury and should thus be used with\ncaution.\n \n\u201cContrary to this myth, there are many preventive steps you can take to\nprotect yourself against liver disease,\u201d says Woreta. The following\nmeasures are recommended:\n \n    If you have the following risk factors for\n    \n    hepatitis C, it is important to speak with your physician about screening, as\n    nearly 50 percent of patients do not know they're infected:\n     Your liver is often an unsung hero, fulfilling over 500 jobs without complaint -- follow these five tips to avoid liver disease and keep yours running at maximum efficiency. \n\u201cLiver cleanses have not been proven to treat existing liver damage,\u201d says\nWoreta, \u201cbut there are many other forms of treatment available for those\nwho are affected.\u201d Here are a few types of liver disease and their\navailable treatment options:\n \n\nObesity\n\nsignificantly increases your risk of developing nonalcoholic fatty liver\ndisease. As mentioned in myth #4, fat in the liver can cause inflammation,\nwhich may lead to the development of fibrosis and\n\ncirrhosis. \u201cDue to the rising epidemic of obesity in the United States, the\nprevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is rapidly increasing and is\nexpected to overtake hepatitis C as the leading indication for    liver transplant\nin the next 30 years,\u201d explains Woreta.\n \nUltimately, the best thing you can do to keep your liver healthy is to\ntreat it well. Avoid frequent overconsumption of food and alcohol, maintain\na healthy diet and exercise regimen, and get screened if you have liver\ndisease risk factors. If you do have liver damage, work with your physician\nto come up with the healthiest and safest plan for your personal needs.\n One of the best things you can do to protect and improve your health is to stay informed.

                            "content4": "Your liver can heal itself after damage over time. Signs can include increased energy and improved blood work. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 1.8% of U.S. adults have liver disease. That\u2019s about 4.5 million people. But people can manage many types of liver diseases and even reverse them.  It\u2019s important to know that your liver can heal and regenerate. As the liver heals, positive changes occur throughout the body. The changes can include improvements in how your digestive system functions, the way your skin looks and feels, increased mental clarity, and higher energy levels.  When your liver regenerates, you may notice some effects. Signs your liver is healing include: Yes, your liver can heal and regenerate. Liver tissue can grow back after it experiences damage or a doctor removes it. This is because the liver can enlarge existing liver cells. New liver cells then grow and multiply in the injury or removal area. However, liver disease can affect your liver\u2019s ability to heal. Scarring and inflammation can slow down and even stop healing.  Quitting alcohol, if possible, is an important step that can help your liver heal. The first week away from drinking can cause withdrawal symptoms as your body adjusts to not having alcohol. Withdrawal symptoms can include: Learn more about how to stop drinking alcohol. Healing can begin within the first few days after drinking stops. Depending on the severity of the damage, complete healing can take weeks or months.  However, not all damage is reversible. If liver damage is extensive and has been long-term, it might not be possible to reverse all of it. Your doctor will discuss the extent of your liver damage, and how much of it can heal, with you.  You might have seen liver \u201cdetox\u201d drinks advertised or sitting on store shelves. These could look like a good idea, but there\u2019s no evidence these drinks do anything to help your liver.  Your liver detoxes and heals itself. You don\u2019t need to spend money on detox products. However, there are some steps you can take to help your liver as it heals.  Your liver is responsible for more than 500 essential body functions, including regulating chemical levels and processing substances in your blood so that your body can use them appropriately. Other important functions of the liver include: Liver disease refers to several different conditions that cause harm to your liver. Liver disease can progress with time and lead to liver scarring, called cirrhosis. If scar tissue replaces enough healthy liver tissue, your liver will not function as it should. It is important to get treatment for liver disease to avoid liver failure.  There are multiple types of liver disease, including: The liver can regenerate and heal, and doctors can cure many liver diseases or manage them if you get early treatment. However, liver disease is serious. Getting treatment as soon as possible can help you prevent permanent damage.  It\u2019s important to get regular check-ups and liver panels to keep an eye on your liver health. That can help doctors detect potential liver disease early and provide treatment right away.  You can learn more about liver healing by reading the answers to some common questions below.  Not all liver disease can be preventable, but you can take these steps to reduce your risk: The exact symptoms of liver disease depend on the specific liver disease you have. For instance, fatty liver disease sometimes has no symptoms at all. However, there are some symptoms that are common among multiple liver diseases. These include: Your liver is the part of your body with the greatest ability to heal and regenerate, but it\u2019s not the only one. Other parts of your body that can regenerate include: Getting liver disease treatment can prevent liver failure and even death. Additionally, it\u2019s possible to reverse many cases of liver damage. In many cases, your liver can regenerate and heal after just a few months.  As your liver heals, you\u2019ll start to feel positive health effects throughout your body, including increased energy, better mental clarity, improved digestion, better skin health, and more.  The sooner you manage your liver disease and take steps to heal your liver, the more your likelihood of reversing liver damage can improve.
